# CloudFormation mapping
---

??? note "This mapping configuration only applies to CloudFormation Processor."
    
    Please refer to another mapping file configuration documentation if needed. 
    You can locate each processor's documentation in the left menu under the "StartLeft Processors (SLP)" section. 

A source mapping file (or "mapping files" for short) describes how to find components, dataflows, and trustzones in source file data structures.

To accomplish this, a mapping file contains additional logic around a collection of JMESPath queries which are used.
Also, some exclusive StartLeft actions based on JMESPath may be used in mapping files to solve the most complex mappings.

Source mapping files are made up of three main sections corresponding to the main sections in an OTM file, plus an optional lookup section described below:

* trustzones
* components
* dataflows

Each contains a list of 0 or more objects that describe how to find the respective object in the source file, and each object has a number of required and optional fields. 

Take a look at the [JSONSchema](https://github.com/iriusrisk/startleft/blob/main/slp_cft/resources/schemas/iac_cft_mapping_schema.json) file for more details.

## JMESPath Queries

---

Special $action fields begin with a dollar sign ($) and do not directly contribute to the OTM output. Instead, they specify an action and behaviour used to process the source files or generate the OTM output. 

This table describes each special $actions:

## Hardcoded values

---

In addition to using $source and other special $actions, you can also just hardcode values which will be taken and mapped as is. For example, you may want to specify a default trustzone which wouldn't be found anywhere in the source files. You can do this easily just by adding it to a mapping file:

```
trustzones:
  - id:   tz1
    name: Default
    type: default-zone
```
The `id` field uniquely identifies a trustzone, and differentiates it from other trustzones of the same type.

For mapping trustzones to IriusRisk trustzones, `type` field must take internal IriusRisk values depending on the type of trustzone.
These values are defined in the internal CloudFormation mapping file.

>For the purpose of preserving backwards compatibility, StartLeft also accepts the legacy mapping file format.
> In this format, there is no `type` field and the `id` will be used as both, ID and type.
>
>It is not possible to have multiple trustzones of the same type when using this format.

## Lookup table

---

Just in case there are some inconsistencies in naming conventions used, and you need to be able to translate one name into another, a simple lookup key-value table section can be added to the mapping file.

For example, if we have a situation where a subnet name is written using a short naming convention, but is actually referred to via a longer name elsewhere, we can use the $lookup action.

```
parent:
  $lookup: {$path: "Properties.Subnets[]|map(&values(@), @)[]|map(&re_sub('[:]', '-', @), @)"}
```

If the above query returns a subnet called `shortnameA`, then it will be looked up in the below table:

```
lookup:
  shortnameA: amuchlongernameA
  shortnameB: amuchlongernameB
```

To give a final value of `amuchlongernameA`.

## Additional JMESPath functions

---

Parsing of IaC files may be sometimes complex, so that the built-in JMESPath described above are not enough. For those cases,
a set of custom functions has been created to simplify and make more powerful the creation of mapping files.

### re_sub
The `re_sub` function replaces the occurrences of `pattern` with `replace` in the given `string`. 

```python
def _func_re_sub(self, pattern, replace, origin_string)
```

For example, we may want to replace colon characters with hyphens such as in `re_sub('[:]', '-', 'stack:subnet')`.

### squash
The `squash` function takes a nested object of objects, and squashes them into a list of objects, injecting the parent "key" to the child object as "_key".

```python
def _func_squash(self, obj)
```

This function is specially useful for Cloudformation mapping files. These have a root `Resources` object whose 
top level keys are the resource names which have the resource objects as values. This structure is hard to iterate over 
without losing the important name key. So you can use squash and refer to the name through the `_key` field. 

```yaml
name:    {$path: "_key"}
$source: {$root: "Resources|squash(@)[?Type=='AWS::EC2::Subnet']"}
```

### tail
The `tail` function returns the characters of a given `string` from the `count` index onwards. It is equivalent to
python's `string[count:]`.

```python
def _func_tail(self, string, count)
```

### get_starts_with

This function is equivalent to `get`, but instead of using the `component_type` argument to perform an exact filter, the
target component type must start with it.

```python
def _func_get_starts_with(self, obj_arr, component_type)
```

### split

The `split` function is the equivalent to the python's one. It breaks a given string based on a given separator and
returns the resulting array of strings. It is equivalent to python's `split` function.
