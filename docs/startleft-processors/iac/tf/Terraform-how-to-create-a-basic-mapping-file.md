# How to Create a Terraform mapping

---

??? note "This mapping configuration only applies to Terraform Processor."
    
    Please refer to another mapping file configuration documentation if needed. 
    You can locate each processor's documentation in the left menu under the "StartLeft Processors (SLP)" section.

A source mapping file (or 'mapping file' for short) describes how to find and map components, dataflows, and TrustZones in
source file data structures.

This mapping file is divided into three sections which correspond to the main sections in an OTM file:

* `trustzones`.
* `components`.
* `dataflows`.

To define the mapping behavior, a Domain-Specific Language has been created to abstract the implementation details 
inside the `slp_tf`, providing a set of `$functions` containing the logic around a collection of JMESPath queries that 
are used.

Take a look at the
<a href="https://github.com/iriusrisk/startleft/blob/main/slp_tf/resources/schemas/iac_tf_mapping_schema.json" target="_blank">JSONSchema</a>
file and the
<a href="https://github.com/iriusrisk/OpenThreatModel" target="_blank">Open Threat Model</a> specification
for more details.

## How to create a Basic Mapping File

---
This section is a Getting Started Guide for a basic mapping file for Terraform.

For a more in-deep explanation, there is available a [How Mapping File works](Terraform-how-mapping-file-works.md) page
and a complete guide about the [Domain-Specific language](Terraform-domain-specific-language.md).

#### Minimal mapping file configuration
> :material-information-outline: Some boilerplate mapping configuration is included out-of-the-box,
> take a look to [How Mapping File works](Terraform-how-mapping-file-works.md) to more details

There is a set of easy-to-use functions that fulfill the most common mapping requirements. Here appear the minimal 
mapping configuration examples that include these functions with their explanation:


```yaml
trustzones: # (1)!
  - id:   public-cloud-01 # (2)!
    name: Public Cloud # (3)!
    type: b61d6911-338d-46a8-9f39-8dcd24abfe91 # (16)!
    $default: true # (4)!
    
  - id:   internet-01
    name: Internet
    type: f0ba7722-39b6-4c81-8290-a30a248bb8d9
    $source: {$singleton: # (5)!
                {$type: "aws_security_group", # (6)!
                 $props: "egress[0].cidr_blocks"} # (7)!
    }

components: # (8)!
  - type:        ec2 # (9)!
    $source: # (10)! 
      {$type: "aws_instance"} # (11)! 

  - type:        generic-client
    $source:     {$type: "aws_security_group",  # (12)!
                  $props: "egress[0].cidr_blocks"} 
    parent:      internet-01 # (13)!
    tags: # (14)!
      - Outbound connection destination IP

dataflows: [] # (15)!
```

1. **trustzones section** defines the TrustZone mapping behavior. At least one TrustZone is needed to be defined
2. set **trustzone[id]** value, which also can be used as a reference when setting the parent of a component `parent: public-cloud`. The `id` field uniquely identifies a trustzone, and differentiates it from other trustzones of the same type.
3. set **trustzone[name]** value
4. *Optional:* **default trustzone** to be used if a component does not define its parent
5. All the matching resources will be **unified** under a single TrustZone which will be created in case the `{$type: "aws_security_group", $props: "egress[0].cidr_blocks"}` query returns any element
6. **mapping function** `$type` performs a search along the entire resource list to return the element with the matching type
7. **mapping function** `$props` performs a search along the entire resource list to return the element with the matching props
8. **components section** defines the component mapping behavior
9. set **component[type]** value
10. **special mapping field** `$source` set the selected resources as the object to be mapped
11. **mapping function** `$type` performs a search along the entire resource list to return the element with the matching type
12. **mapping function** performs a query combining `$type` and `$props` functions returning a list of $source to be mapped into a component for each existing Terraform resource that matches those conditions
13. *Optional:* set **component[parent]** as the *Internet TrustZone*
14. *Optional:* set **component[tag]** value
15. **dataflows section** is explained in detail on [How Dataflow Mapping works](Terraform-how-dataflow-mapping-works.md)
16. set **trustzone[type]** value. For mapping trustzones to IriusRisk trustzones, `type` field must take internal IriusRisk values depending on the type of trustzone.

##### Special mapping fields
These functions begin with a dollar sign ($) and do not directly contribute to the OTM output. 
Instead, they specify an action or behavior used to process the source files or generate the OTM output.

| $functions | Description                             | Applies to                         |
|------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| $default   | Specifies the TrustZone as default      | TrustZones                         |
| $source    | Specifies the source of the object type | Components, TrustZones & Dataflows |

##### Mapping functions
These functions are used as parameters of the mapping attributes for configuring its behavior. 

| $functions | Type   | Description                                                          | Consumes            | Produces                                        |
|------------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| $type      | filter | Finds a resource by its type                                         | A list of resources | A resources list filtered by type               |
| $props     | filter | Finds a resource by its properties                                   | A list of resources | A resources list filtered by the given props    |
| $singleton | group  | Specific objects to be unified under a single component or TrustZone | A list of resources | A list of resources grouped by the given params |
